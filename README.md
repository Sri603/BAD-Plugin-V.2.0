## 🔧 Key Features

The BAD 2.0 plugin introduces major enhancements over the original version to streamline the workflow of burned area detection and validation. These include:

- **🎯 SCL Band Masking**  
  Perform masking of unwanted Scene Classification Layer (SCL) classes from Sentinel-2 imagery for both pre-fire and post-fire datasets. This removes noise (e.g., clouds, water, snow) and improves classification accuracy.

- **🛰️ OWA Layer Preview**  
  Visually inspect Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) layers to help select optimal threshold values for generating seed and grow layers. An interactive preview allows accurate threshold tuning using real-time image feedback.

- **✅ Burned Area Map Validation**  
  Validate the burned area output by comparing with reference data using a confusion matrix. Compute accuracy metrics such as commission/omission errors, Dice coefficient, and generate a pixel-wise **Agreement Map**.

- **🔥 Burn Severity Validation**  
  Validate burn severity output by reclassifying and comparing the severity layer with reference data, including full error matrix evaluation and export of metrics for reporting.

- **📦 Modular Workflow**  
  Each tab in the plugin works independently—users can start at any stage (e.g., OWA, Region Growing) using intermediate inputs, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.

- **📊 Export of Validation Results**  
  All validation results, including accuracy metrics and confusion matrices, are exportable in `.html` format for inclusion in reports or publications.

- **🌐 QGIS Native**  
  Fully integrated within the QGIS environment with a PyQt-based graphical interface and support for native raster and vector operations.
